## Project summary
**Business case:** The fictitious client Blackwell Electronics (BE) is a mature electronics retailer recently entering the ecommerce market. To strengthen its market position, BE is considering to acquire Electronidex, a start-up specialised in electronics ecommerce. For the acquisition decision a deep analysis of customer buying patterns is required to evaluate the strategic fit of both companies.  
  
**Goal of analysis:** The goal of analysis is to perform a market basket analysis on Electronidex transaction data to discover customer buying patterns, market segments Electronidex serves and relations between certain products purchased. This analysis aims at recommendations on strategic fit of both companies and the business impact of BE's ecommerce associated with acquisition.      

## Technical approach of analysis  
  
**1. Exploration and preparation of data**  
  
**2. Comparison of product portfolio**    
Visualize the product portfolio of both companies to draw insights on differences and similarities.  
  
**3. Analysis on customer segments (B2C, B2B)**  
Find a meaningful way to relate transactions to customer segments, i.e. consumer and business customers.  
  
**4. Association rules mining**  
Apply the Apriori algorithm on the transaction data to mine rules on customer buying behaviour.  
  
**5. Selection of rules**  
Select the rules found by the Apriori algorithm in terms of the following metrics: 'support', 'confidence', and 'lift'.
